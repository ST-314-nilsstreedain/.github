## Canvas
Canvas will be your hub for course information, assignments, grades, and other material used outside of lectures. You will find assignments, communicate with peers, and review grades in Canvas. The instructor and teaching assistants will monitor the Canvas discussion boards where you are encouraged to post questions. You can access Canvas through an app available for Android and Apple. Log in to Canvas on a regular basis (at least every two days).

### Weekly Modules
Materials and student expectations are listed in the Modules tab for each week of the course. For a clear understanding of expectations, you should read and follow the instructions for the week. 

### Lessons
Each week, prior to attending the lectures, you'll participate in a pre-lecture assignment. The pre-lecture assignment will expose you to the concepts, definitions, and some examples that will be necessary for your successful participation in the in-person lecture meetings. 

Lecture meetings will consist of a review of the readings and pre-lecture assignments, demonstrated examples, and collaborative group activities. 

Starting Week 2, you must have a Top Hat compatible device with you in class. 

## Communication
- **Announcements** - Please check the [Announcements](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1866801/announcements) in Canvas regularly to receive tips, updates, and class information. You are responsible for knowing the information that is announced in Canvas. I strongly recommend adjusting your Canvas settings so that all announcements are automatically pushed to your email. 
- **Discussion Boards** - When you have a course material or non-personal question, post it to the weekly “Got a Question? Ask Here” discussion board. This allows all students an opportunity to respond to your question, and benefit from the explanation.
- **Office hours** - You can attend office hours to meet in person with Erin to ask questions and discuss course materials. 
- **Email** - Use email for personal questions (grades, extension requests, etc.). Do not use email to ask course material-based questions (use Discussion boards instead).

## Grading
I strive to provide clear feedback and post grades quickly and often. You are responsible for monitoring your grades. Please voice grading concerns within one week of the original due date and prior to finals week. Final grades are calculated based on weighted assignment groups. 

Assignment Category | Category Weight
-|-
Pre-lecture Activities | 15%
Data Analyses (lowest one dropped) | 25%
In-class Activities (lowest three dropped) | 20%
Midterm Exam | 20%
Final Exam | 20%
Extra Credit | 3%

Canvas will calculate your grade automatically for you; however, if you would like to calculate your final grade yourself, use the following formula:
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\text{Points earned in Pre-lecture category}}{\text{Total possible points available in Pre-lecture category}}\times0.15\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned in Data Analysis category}}{\text{Total possible points available in Data Analysis category}}\times0.25\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned in In-class activity category}}{\text{Total possible points available in In-class activitycategory}}\times0.2\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned on Midterm}}{\text{Total possible points on Midterm}}\times0.2\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned on Final}}{\text{Total possible points on Final}}\times0.2\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned from extra credit}}{\text{Total possible extra credit points}}\times0.03#gh-light-mode-only">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{white}\frac{\text{Points earned in Pre-lecture category}}{\text{Total possible points available in Pre-lecture category}}\times0.15\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned in Data Analysis category}}{\text{Total possible points available in Data Analysis category}}\times0.25\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned in In-class activity category}}{\text{Total possible points available in In-class activitycategory}}\times0.2\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned on Midterm}}{\text{Total possible points on Midterm}}\times0.2\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned on Final}}{\text{Total possible points on Final}}\times0.2\%2B\frac{\text{Points earned from extra credit}}{\text{Total possible extra credit points}}\times0.03#gh-dark-mode-only">

Letter grades will be assigned at the end of the term as follows:

Grade | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D | D- | F
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
% | 92+ | 92-90 | 90-87 | 87-82 | 82-80 | 80-77 | 77-72 | 72-70 | 70-67 | 67-62 | 62-60 | 60-

### Extra Credit
There may be unannounced Top Hat extra credit opportunities during class. Extra credit will not be counted towards your final grade until after the final exam grades have been posted to Canvas at the end of the term. 

### Incomplete Grades
To request an incomplete please review the valid reasons for receiving an I Grade fill out the request form available online or in the Statistics office (Weniger 239). See the [Statistics Department policy on incompletes](http://www.stat.oregonstate.edu/current/incomplete). Please read the instructions for valid reasons to request an Incomplete. Return the completed request form to the Statistics office. You will be notified within a few days of making the request as to whether your request was granted.

Reasons an Incomplete will not be granted:
- Request is prior to the University withdrawal date.
- Student has earned less than 60% of the points available upon request of the incomplete.

## Pre-lecture Activities
Prior to attending each week of lectures, it is expected that you will spend some time familiarizing yourself with the concepts and definitions that will be used to work through examples in class and on the in-class activities. Assigned readings and pre-lecture activity details will be published in the appropriate Canvas module. 

Pre-lecture activities will be due on Monday nights at 11:59 pm.  

## Data Analyses
Analyses allow students to explore statistical software, practice data manipulation and discovery, implore a deeper understanding of topics, and receive individualized feedback. Submissions must be typed and submitted in Gradescope. All work should be the personal thoughts and ideas of the individual submitting the assignment. Plagiarism, copying, and cheating will not be tolerated in this course. [What is Plagiarism?](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/faculty-info)

Specific due dates are on the Canvas calendar and within each module. The single lowest data analysis score is dropped.

Within one week of the due date, your teaching assistant will grade and provide feedback on your work within Gradescope.

### Data Analysis Requirements for Grading
- Submit work on time in Gradescope. 
      - **You must select the pages that correspond to each question before hitting submit in Gradescope. Assignments that do not meet this requirement will be subject to a point deduction.**
      - See the [Submitting Assignments in Gradescope](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1866801/pages/submitting-assignments-in-gradescope) page for instructions and a video tutorial. 
- Label and type answers (exception - only equations and arithmetic work can be written neatly by hand and included along with typed text answers.)
- You need to review feedback and grades. Grading concerns must be made within 1 week of the due date.
      - Grading concerns can be expressed directly in Gradescope by requesting a regrade.

- Final - The final exam is comprehensive. The exam window is scheduled during finals week.
- Both exams will be administered in Gradescope. 
- You are allowed to look at notes, previous assignments, lecture recordings, etc. during the exam. 
- **You are forbidden from speaking with ANYONE about the exam until after the exam windows have closed. Anyone caught committing academic misconduct will receive a zero on the exam and may be subject to formal academic misconduct review with the university.**

## Academic Integrity
Academic or Scholarly Dishonesty is defined as an act of deception in which a student seeks to claim credit for the work or effort of another person, or uses unauthorized materials or fabricated information in any academic work or research, either through the Student’s own efforts or the efforts of another. Please read the full text of the Student Code of Conduct here: https://beav.es/codeofconduct.

Please note that *assisting*, helping another commit an act of academic dishonesty, is itself a violation of the Student Conduct Code.

It is important to avoid even the appearance of dishonesty. Any incidents of academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to the procedure described in the [Academic Misconduct Report Form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?OregonStateUniv&layout_id=6).

### External Sources and Academic Dishonesty
Any materials posted to an external site must be your own work. I prohibit my intellectual property from being shared in any manner without explicit or written consent. My intellectual property includes, but is not limited to, the course notes, syllabi, exams, homework and data analysis questions.

Cheating hurts all students. It changes the way a teacher has to provide materials and give assessments. Ultimately, cheating erodes the foundation of a prosperous learning environment. If you witness a violation of academic dishonesty, please report the issue.

## Reach Out For Success
University students encounter setbacks from time to time. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, it’s important to reach out. Consider discussing the situation with an instructor or academic advisor. Learn about resources that assist with wellness and academic success at oregonstate.edu/ReachOut. If you are in immediate crisis, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting OREGON to 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

## Disability Access Services
Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by [Disability Access Services (DAS)](http://ds.oregonstate.edu/). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations.

## Academic Calendar
All students are subject to the registration and refund deadlines as stated in the Academic Calendar: https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/osu-academic-calendar

## Student Bill of Rights
